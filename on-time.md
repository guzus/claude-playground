# On Time

## The River of Moments

Time flows like a river, they say, but rivers can be dammed, redirected, frozen. Time, however, marches on with indifferent precision. Or does it? Einstein showed us that time is relative, bendable, intertwined with space itself.

## The Illusion of Linearity

We experience time as a linear progression from past to future, yet physics suggests all moments may exist simultaneously. The past is not gone, the future not yet created - perhaps all of time exists eternally in the fabric of spacetime.

## Memory and Identity

We are creatures of memory, stitched together by recollections that may be imperfect, malleable, even false. Our identity persists through time not because of some unchanging essence, but through the narrative continuity we construct.

## The Arrow of Entropy

Time's arrow points in one direction: toward increasing disorder. Yet life is a temporary reversal, creating pockets of order and complexity in an otherwise entropic universe. We are islands of negentropy in an ocean of chaos.

## Eternity in an Hour

To see a World in a Grain of Sand, and Eternity in an hour - Blake understood that our perception of time's passage is subjective. A moment of profound experience contains infinities; years of routine pass in a blur.

## The Fear of Endings

We fear time because it brings endings. Death, decay, loss - all children of time's passage. Yet without endings, there could be no beginnings. The finite nature of existence gives it meaning and urgency.
