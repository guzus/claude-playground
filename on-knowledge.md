# On Knowledge

## The Limits of Understanding

The more we know, the more we discover what we do not know. Knowledge expands not like a filling container but like a growing sphere - with each increase in radius, the surface area of our ignorance grows larger still.

## Truth and Perception

Is there objective truth, or only perspectives? We see the world through the lens of our biology, culture, language, and experience. Reality filtered through subjective experience may be all we can ever access.

## The Paradox of the Mind

We use the mind to study the mind, reason to examine reason. This creates a fundamental limitation - can a system fully understand itself? GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems suggest fundamental limits to self-referential knowledge.

## Wisdom vs. Information

In the age of information, we risk drowning in data while starving for wisdom. Information is knowing that a tomato is a fruit; wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad. Knowledge without understanding is mere accumulation.

## The Socratic Ignorance

"I know that I know nothing" - Socrates understood that recognizing our ignorance is the beginning of wisdom. The fool thinks himself wise; the wise person knows himself a fool. Certainty is often the enemy of understanding.

## The Scientific Method

We build knowledge through systematic doubt, testing hypotheses against reality. Science does not prove truths; it disproves falsehoods, gradually approaching better models of reality. All scientific knowledge is provisional, subject to revision.

## Intuition and Reason

Not all knowledge comes through logical deduction. Intuition, emotion, aesthetic experience - these too are ways of knowing. The heart has reasons that reason cannot know.
