## Philosophy

These writings explore timeless philosophical questions through various lenses - existentialism, phenomenology, epistemology, and metaphysics. They are meant to provoke thought rather than provide answers.

## Purpose

This playground serves as a space for contemplation, a repository for thinking about thinking, and an invitation to grapple with questions that have no easy answers.
